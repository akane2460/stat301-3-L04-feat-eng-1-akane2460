## Overview

The goal of this lab is to (1) provide an in-depth understanding of errors/warnings related to factor variables, (2) demonstrate different imputation techniques, and (3) introduce a new model type: neural networks.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the questions provided in `LO4_feature_engineering_I.html`. A template is provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L04.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which should contain a link to your github repo. Including the github repo link takes the place of having to submit the additional qmd and r files. See canvas for submission details.
